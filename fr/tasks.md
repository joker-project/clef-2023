  <h2 align="center">Automatic Wordplay Analysis</h2> 


### Tasks, evaluation setup, and metrics
In the edition, we propose three shared tasks:
* **Task 1: Pun detection** in English, French, and Spanish. We will use the corpora which were a side result of JOKER-2022 [1] and the augmented data of SemEval-2017 [2] as well as standard evaluation metrics for binary classification (precision, recall, accuracy)
* **Task 2: Pun location and interpretation** in English, French, and Spanish. We will use the extended corpus of JOKER-2022 Task 1. We will evaluate location based on the accuracy and the interpretation based on paronyms and synonyms.
* **Task 3: Pun translation** from English to French and to Spanish. We will use the extended version of the corpus of JOKER-2022 Task 3 and we will continue to evaluate the generated translation manually.
* **Open Task:** in English, French, and Spanish. In addition, we encourage the use of our data for tasks related to computational wordplay and humour. These could take the form of experiment reports on humour perception, evaluation, wordplay generation, or user studies. Register for any of the aforementioned shared task if you are interested in this open task.
